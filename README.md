# OneFile
I am someone who is always learning literally anything related to tech randomly on the internet. After learning so many things and forgetting them all again and again ( Because of not being able to use it frequently) I have decided to log all my knowledge notes in one place.

The motto is pretty simple - A person should be able to understand almost all about the stuff going through these concise snippets of notes on the topics prescribed in The OneFile. 

#### One file - One place - All of it
